Introduction
============

minisi is a C++ library for calculations with compile-time unit checking. It
is similar to boost.units, but simpler. The feature set is very compact, but so
is the library.

For using the library no dependencies beneath the standard library (and C++17)
are needed. The unit tests require the boost.test framework.

Building
========

The library is header-only. If you want to build the unit tests, this is done
using cmake.
